== Codification

Rules have a code in the form: `Letter + 3 digits`. The number is an incremental counter. The prefix letter can be:

* **`S`**: for syntactic rules.
* **`E`**: for evaluation rules.

== Syntactic rules

=== Integer!

=== Float!

=== Char!

A char! value is of the form #"<valid Unicode codepoint>". The codepoint can be supplied as either a displayable character or hexidecimal digit(s). Hexidecimal digits should be supplied in the form ^(hh), ^(hhhh) or ^(hhhhhh) or ^(hhhhhhhh). 

For example:

#"a" equivalent to #"^(61)"

#"Ã©" equivalent to #"^(E9)"

#"â‚¬" equivalent to #"^(20AC)"

#"ðŸ˜€" equivalent to #"^(01F600)"

== Types

=== Type list

*TBD: Provide a table with all the datatypes and a brief description of their purpose.*

=== Type groups

=== Type hierarchy


== Binding

=== Contexts

=== Binding process


== Comparison

=== Equality

=== Strict equality

=== Sameness

=== Type ordering

=== Type comparisons


== Conversion


== Evaluation rules

`a -> b` will be used to signify evaluation relation, from value or type `a` to value or type `b`.

=== Passive types

**`E100`**:: For all values of type in `passive!` typeset: `value -> value`. This is called the **identity rule**.

=== Decaying types

**`E101`**:: `lit-word! -> word!`. Evaluating a `'word` value results in its `word` counterpart.

**`E102`**:: `lit-path! -> path!`. Evaluating a `'v0/v1/.../vn` value results in its `v0/v1/.../vn` counterpart.
